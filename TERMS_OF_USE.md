## Manabi Grammar DB Terms of Use

**Effective date:** October 23, 2025  
**Responsible entity:** Manabi (operating at [manabi.io](https://manabi.io)), headquartered in Canada

These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Manabi Grammar Database, related documentation, programmatic interfaces, and any other technical spaces or services we host (collectively, the "Services"). By using the Services you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, you may not use the Services.

## 1. Our Services

Manabi is dedicated to encouraging the growth, development, and distribution of free multilingual grammar content, and to hosting that content for the public free of charge. We provide the infrastructure and organizational framework so that our community can contribute, edit, and reuse grammar materials across websites, documentation, and supporting APIs. We generally do not take an editorial role and do not monitor or edit community-contributed content. Consequently, you are legally responsible for your own submissions, reuse, and any actions you take when interacting with the Services. Applicable law includes at least the laws of Canada; authorities in other jurisdictions may also seek to apply their laws to your activity, and we cannot offer immunity from those laws.

## 2. Content We Host

Because community members provide and curate the content, you may encounter material that you consider offensive, inaccurate, misleading, mislabeled, or otherwise objectionable. Use common sense and proper judgment when working with the Services. All hosted content is provided for general informational purposes only and does not constitute professional advice. Please consult a qualified professional before relying on the content for medical, legal, financial, or other specialized guidance.

## 3. Refraining from Certain Activities

To maintain a civil and collaborative environment, you may not engage in activities that harm other users, violate applicable law, or disrupt the Services, including but not limited to:

- **Harassing or abusing others:** threats, stalking, spamming, vandalism, or content intended to seriously harm others (such as deliberate inducements to self-harm or deliberate triggering of epilepsy).
- **Violating privacy:** soliciting or posting personal data for harassment, exploitation, or undisclosed commercial purposes; impersonating others or misrepresenting affiliations; engaging in fraud.
- **Infringing intellectual property:** violating copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other proprietary rights.
- **Misusing the Services for unlawful purposes:** posting or distributing child sexual abuse material, trafficking in unlawful obscene content, or otherwise using the Services contrary to applicable law.
- **Disrupting our infrastructure:** attempting denial-of-service attacks, automated data exfiltration that ignores published rate limits, or other abusive technical behavior.

You are also expected to follow any applicable community policies and codes of conduct linked from the repositories and websites we provide.

## 4. Trademarks

Manabi trademarks, service marks, logos, and domain names (collectively, "Manabi Marks") are protected. You may use Manabi Marks only as permitted by applicable trademark law and any published Manabi trademark guidelines. Misuse of Manabi Marks or confusingly similar marks is prohibited.

## 5. Licensing of Content

- **Grammar dataset (open content).** The grammar entries, YAML metadata, Markdown guides, and other textual/linguistic materials stored in the Manabi Grammar Database are released under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license ("CC BY-SA 4.0"). When you contribute to, reuse, or remix this dataset, you must comply with CC BY-SA 4.0, including attribution, indication of changes, and the share-alike obligation. No GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL) terms apply to this dataset.
- **Sui generis database rights.** Where you own sui generis database rights that would otherwise apply to contributions covered by CC BY-SA 4.0, you waive those rights to the fullest extent permitted by law. For example, factual data you add to the Grammar Database may be reused freely without attribution.
- **Website, applications, and tooling (proprietary).** The Manabi Grammar Web application, related frontend/backend code, build pipelines, and the `manabi-grammar-swift` repository (including its binaries, source, and wasm outputs) are proprietary and copyrighted by Manabi. Except where Manabi provides a separate written license, you may **not** copy, redistribute, modify, or create derivative works from these software assets.

By submitting content to the Grammar Database you grant the community permission to use it under CC BY-SA 4.0. These Terms do not grant any license to Manabi’s proprietary software or branding.

## 6. Copyright Compliance and DMCA Process

We respond to notices of alleged infringement that satisfy the requirements of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") or other applicable law. Recurring infringers may have their access terminated. If you believe your copyright-protected work appears on the Services without your permission, email a detailed DMCA notice to **legal@manabi.io**. If you believe a takedown request has been made in error, you are encouraged to submit a counter notice as permitted by law. We may post valid DMCA requests (and any counter notices) to transparency resources such as the [Lumen Database](https://www.lumendatabase.org/).

## 7. Third-Party Websites and Resources

The Services may link to or integrate third-party websites, APIs, or resources. Manabi does not endorse, control, or warrant third-party content, products, or services. You alone are responsible for your use of third-party resources and for complying with their terms.

## 8. Management of the Services

Community processes handle most content moderation and policy decisions. You can usually address issues faster by working with the relevant community channels first. If you need to notify Manabi directly about illegal content or violations of these Terms, contact **legal@manabi.io**. We may, at our sole discretion or where legally required, investigate reported conduct; detect, prevent, or address fraud, security, or technical issues; refuse, revert, disable, or restrict access to contributions; block or ban accounts for repeat violations; or take legal action against users who breach these Terms or applicable law. Software-based enforcement (for example, automated traffic protection) may complement these efforts, and human review is available upon reasonable request. Users who are banned may not create replacement accounts without explicit permission.

## 9. Termination

You may stop using the Services at any time. In limited circumstances, Manabi, the community, or both may suspend or terminate portions of the Services, terminate these Terms, block accounts, or otherwise restrict access to protect users, comply with law, or maintain service integrity. If you believe a termination or moderation action was in error, follow the appeal process communicated in the relevant notice.

## 10. Disclaimers

Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. The Services are provided "as is" and "as available," without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including (without limitation) implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Manabi does not guarantee that the Services will meet your requirements, be secure, uninterrupted, timely, accurate, or error-free, or that your information will remain secure. Manabi is not responsible for the content, data, or actions of third parties, and you release Manabi, its officers, directors, employees, contractors, and agents from claims and damages arising out of or connected to third-party conduct. Any material you download or otherwise obtain through the Services is at your own discretion and risk.

## 11. Limitation on Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Manabi will not be liable to you or any other party for direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages—including loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses—even if advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event will Manabi's aggregate liability exceed one thousand Canadian dollars (CAD $1,000). Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations; in those jurisdictions our liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.

## 12. Modifications to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time and may do so without advance notice. When we make material changes, we will update the effective date above. Your continued use of the Services after any update constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the changes, you must stop using the Services.

## 13. Other Terms

These Terms do not create an employment, agency, partnership, joint control, or joint venture relationship between you and Manabi. If any provision of these Terms is found unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining provisions will remain in full effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Manabi unless we have executed a separate written agreement with you. We may provide notices to you via email, posted updates, or other reasonable means. Our failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of that provision.

## 14. Thank You

Thank you for contributing to and using the Manabi Grammar Database. Your participation helps build a collaborative resource that supports learners and educators worldwide.
